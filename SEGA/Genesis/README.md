How to play:

The traditional way: https://www.carpeludum.com/kega-fusion/

The new & improved way: https://www.retrodev.com/blastem/

The fancy "I'm-a-programmer-too" way: http://mamedev.org/

Download the emulator of your choice. Fusion & BlastEm are point & click GUI affairs. MAME ... isn't. Download the ROM (.bin) file, load it into an emulator of your choice, and that should be it.
