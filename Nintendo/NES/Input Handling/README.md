A series of examples on how to read data from the controller ports ($4016 & $4017)

- NES Input Handler 01 reads data from both controller ports
- NES Input Handler 02 uses input from controller 1 to move a sprite on screen
- NES Input Handler 03 uses input from controllers 1 and 2 to move sprites on screen using slightly more complex code
- NES Input Handler 04 moves sprites on screen using directional vectors
- NES Input Handler 05 deals with reading data from an NES Four Score™

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  We 
are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop our FOSS project. We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not
a good place to host FOSS projects.
