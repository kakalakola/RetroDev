These are a series of projects I worked on trying to learn how to program in Z80 assembly. They've been compiled with TNIASM, and tested to work with BGB, MAME, and no$gmb.

Project listing:
 - GB Init 00 - Compiling a working ROM
 - GB Init 01 - Going through a "proper" boot sequence
 - GB Init 02 - Handling input
 - GB Init 03 - Scanline interrupt
 - GB Init 04 - Sound with the noise channel
 - GB Init 05 - Pointers and data blocks
 - GB Init 06 - Writing to VRAM
 - GB Init 07 - Window register and multiple scanline interrupts
 - GB Init 08 - Working with sprites
 - GB Init 09 - Working with meta sprites
 - GB Init 10 - Spawning/Despawning a "bullet"
